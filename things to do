things to do:
For Y axis, use powers of 10. "Semilog"

Find Alisyn Camerota's Twitter account from archives and add her to the list
Her case is an interesting example of why we need to study this

Test the 30 day grace period for Twitter deactivation "DONE"




Set the X axis stable from beginning of twitter to today
Make Y axis dynamic 


Pull flotus account to see if people followed that account instead of michele obama's account between 2012-2016

Get everyone's (all 50-60 people) twitter account follower history counts 

Look up aggregate growth of people to be able to put graphs together. So we can compare growth, not necessarily number
(Normalizing Y axis)
